# JVN Documentation

This directory is the source of truth for Java Vector Nexus editor, runtime, scripting, packaging, and workflow docs.

Start with the public documentation website at [javavectornexus.com](https://javavectornexus.com)
when you want the searchable, hosted guide tree. Start with the detailed [Documentation Index](INDEX.md)
when editing docs in this repository. It is organized by task first, then by subsystem.

## Maintenance Notes

- Generated screenshot docs use `generated-*.md` names and are refreshed by docs screenshot tasks.
- Prefer linking to section landing pages first, then deep pages for specific APIs or tools.
- Keep implementation-specific docs anchored to current source file names when possible, especially under `editor/`.
- Follow the [Documentation Maintenance Guide](MAINTENANCE.md) when adding, moving, or reviewing pages.
