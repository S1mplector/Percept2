## Layout Overview

### Startup welcome dashboard

- The center area opens with a `Welcome` tab by default.
- Shows:
  - JVN logo + editor version
  - recent projects (with one-click open)
  - workspace/project health checks (Java, Gradle wrapper, Git, missing project files)
- Quick actions:
  - `New Project`
  - `Open Project`
  - `Refresh Health`

### Top bar

- Menus: `File`, `Edit`, `View`, `Navigate`, `Run`, `Build`, `Tools`, `Version Control`, `Window`, `Help`
- Main actions: `Open`, `Save`, `Undo`, `Redo`, `Apply Code`, `Fullscreen`
- Status + performance strip (CPU/GPU/RAM/FPS)
- In Engine Hub Developer Mode, a collapsed `Logs` panel appears under the top bar for crude log-file viewing.
- In Engine Hub Developer Mode, a `DevTools` menu appears in the menu bar for runtime diagnostics, log refresh, manual GC, and next-launch editor heap settings.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+,` opens Editor Settings.

### Left panel: Project Explorer

- Project tree with filter box
- Root-level **Run** button for full project runtime launch
- Root-level **Build** button for the game build/publish popup
- Context menu actions:
  - open
  - reveal in file manager
  - new JES/VNS/Java/folder
  - rename
  - delete

### Center panel: Tabbed editors

Files open into typed tabs via `FileEditorTab` dispatch:

- VNS (`.vns`) -> VNS code editor + VN preview
- JES (`.jes`) -> JES code editor + viewport preview
- Timeline (`.timeline`) -> timeline graph + timeline code editor
- Menu/theme/layout config -> text-first Layout Studio with diagnostics and runtime launch
- General text/code formats -> text editor

For VNS tabs, diagnostics are routed to the side diagnostics panel to preserve vertical editor space.

### Side panels (+ chooser system)

- Left defaults to `Project` tab.
- Right starts empty; use `+` to open a panel chooser.
- Common addable panels include:
  - `Project`
  - `Timeline`
  - `VNS Diagnostics`
  - `Label Flow`
  - `Assets`
  - `Version Control`
  - `Inspector`
  - `Puppeteer Launcher`
  - `Storyboard Overlay`
  - `Layered Image Visualizer`
  - `Image Attributes Tool`
  - `Scene Lighting Studio`
  - `Layout Launcher`
  - `Text Editor`

## Project Run Behavior

Project run from editor:

1. Reads `jvn.project` from project root.
2. For VN projects (`type=vn`), launches runtime with:
   - `--assets <projectRoot>`
   - normalized `--script <entryVns>` when manifest entry is defined
   - otherwise runtime-side entry resolution (`entryVns`/property/discovery)
3. Executes Gradle with isolated user home:
   - `.jvn-gradle-user-home`
   - `--no-daemon`, `--console=plain`, VFS watch disabled

This design avoids shared global lock issues and makes editor-run more consistent across machines.

## Game Build & Publish

Open **Build -> Build & Publish...**, **File -> Project -> Build & Publish...**, **Run -> Build & Publish...**, or the Project Explorer root **Build** button to package the current JVN game project.

The popup now supports:

- **Portable Zip**: cross-target zip, Java required on the player machine
- **Desktop Bundle**: cross-target self-contained zip with a packaged target runtime
- **Native Package**: current-host `jpackage` output such as `dmg`, `pkg`, `exe`, `msi`, `deb`, `rpm`, or `app-image`

The popup reads `jvn.project`, lets you set the release name/version, target, format, native package type, and release profile, validates the selection, and launches the matching Gradle task in the run console. **Scan Dependencies** runs the deeper shipping validator inside the popup, grouping errors, warnings, and cleanup notes for missing media, broken menu/script/stage/timeline references, unused media, and packaging blockers. Each finding can be copied or opened at the closest local source file/folder, and **Run Console Scan** remains available for Gradle-style output. Outputs are written to `build/distributions/games/` in the JVN workspace by default, or to the `jvnBuildDir` location configured in the workspace `gradle.properties`.

Build actions stay disabled until the selected project is packageable. The validation checks for a readable `jvn.project`, `type=vn` or `type=jes`, an existing VN `entryVns` or JES `entry` file, a supported target, a writable output folder, accidental selection of the engine workspace, and release-profile availability when native packaging is selected.

Portable zips and desktop bundles can target any supported desktop platform from the popup. The first desktop-bundle build for a target downloads and verifies a packaged runtime, then reuses the local cache on later builds. Native packages remain host-only, so the popup requires the **Current machine** target for that mode. The **Run Release Profile** action builds the selected artifact and then runs any configured signing, notarization, and publish hooks from the game's release profile.

For CLI usage and target details, see [Build System](../../project-setup/release/build-system.md).
For the format chooser and shipping guidance, see [JVN Build And Release Docs](../../project-setup/release/README.md).

Related preferences live in [Editor And Launcher Settings](settings.md):

- confirm before running from the editor
- save dirty files before project runs
- runtime performance HUD on project launch
- default Gradle `-x test` behavior when `jvn.project` does not define `args`
- sidebar panel default placement and chooser visibility

## Tool Access Patterns

The editor now exposes most tooling through more than one route so teams can keep a stable workflow even when the sidebar layout changes:

- **Sidebar chooser (`+`)** for persistent left/right panel placement
- **View -> Panels** for panel-first navigation
- **Navigate** for quick jumps to the same tools
- **Tools** for task-oriented grouping
- **Window -> Open Tool Window** for floating utility windows such as Storyboard Overlay

This matters for workflow-critical utilities such as **Build & Publish...**, **Storyboard Overlay**, **Version Control**, **Puppeteer Launcher**, and **Scene Lighting Studio**, because they can be reopened from the menu system even when their sidebar tab is closed.

## Supported Editing Modes

### VNS editor

- syntax highlighting
- strict parser diagnostics (same parser as runtime)
- lint for:
  - undefined labels
  - missing assets/background ids
  - unreachable labels/blocks
- quick fixes via context menu on diagnostics:
  - create missing label
  - replace label with existing one
  - replace missing asset path from discovered assets
  - remove unreachable block
- side-panel integrations:
  - `VNS Diagnostics` panel with filter + click-to-jump lines
  - `Label Flow` graph panel for label/jump/choice flow

### JES editor

- syntax highlighting
- parser lint diagnostics
- live apply into preview viewport

### Timeline editor

- graph editing + text DSL editing
- arc/link validation against script existence and labels
- drag-and-drop `.vns` files to create arcs quickly
- cluster filtering/collapse and auto layout

### Menu flow editor

- dedicated graph for menu-to-menu navigation wiring across `config/menu/menus/*.menu`
- visual wiring support for:
  - `OPEN_MENU` (click source item, then click target menu node)
  - `MAIN_MENU`
  - `BACK`
- inline item action/target editing per selected menu screen
- validation for:
  - missing `OPEN_MENU` targets
  - unknown menu targets
  - missing standard targets (`main`, `load`, `save`, `settings`) when referenced
  - duplicate/empty item ids
  - unreachable menus from `main`
- save one screen or save all modified screens

### Layout configuration authoring

These open in dedicated external **Layout Studio** windows with:

- DSL-aware source editing and line diagnostics
- complete, commented source templates
- direct Save / Reload / Save and Run Runtime
- asset utilities (browse/import/copy/apply path helpers)

The supported sources are `config/ui/dialogue.layout`, `config/menu/menus/*.menu`,
`config/menu/layouts/*.layout`, and `config/menu/styles/*.style`. They are ordinary properties files
consumed directly by the runtime. Layout Studio does not maintain a parallel form model or preview
renderer; use Save and Run Runtime for authoritative rendering and interaction checks.

## New Project Wizard

The wizard creates a layered VN project scaffold with:

- `config/settings`, `config/story`, `config/ui`, `config/menu/...`
- `scripts/story`, `scripts/common`, `scripts/system`
- structured `assets/` subfolders for backgrounds/characters/audio/ui/fonts
- `jvn.project` manifest with entry script and config paths
- optional Git repository + initial commit

See full wizard documentation:
- [New Project Wizard](../../project-setup/onboarding/new-project-wizard.md)

## VNS Preview Virtual Viewport

The VNS preview renders at the **game's target resolution** (read from `jvn.project`), then scales to fit the editor canvas. This ensures that what you see in the editor preview matches exactly what the player sees at runtime.

### How it works

1. `ProjectViewportSpec` reads `width` and `height` from `jvn.project` (defaults to 1920×1080).
2. The preview computes a uniform scale factor: `min(canvasWidth / gameWidth, canvasHeight / gameHeight)`.
3. The scene is rendered at the virtual game resolution inside a `gc.scale()` transform.
4. Black letterbox bars fill any remaining canvas area when aspect ratios differ.
5. Mouse coordinates are inverse-transformed from canvas space → virtual space so clicks, hover detection, and overlays work correctly.

### Why this matters

- **Puppeteer timelines** use absolute pixel coordinates (e.g., `x: 739, y: 140`) authored for the game resolution. Without the virtual viewport, these coordinates go off-screen in the smaller editor preview.
- **Custom character positions** use screen fractions that resolve to game-resolution pixels. The preview must render at that resolution for correct placement.
- **Dialogue and UI layouts** are resolution-dependent. The preview now shows the correct textbox proportions and choice button positions.

### Configuration

The game resolution is set in `jvn.project`:

```properties
width=1920
height=1080
```

This is automatically configured by the New Project Wizard based on the selected resolution. If no `jvn.project` exists, the preview defaults to 1920×1080.

## Recommended Team Workflow

1. Keep story logic in VNS with clear label naming.
2. Keep UI tuning in config files edited through visual tools when practical.
3. Use timeline graph for arc-level narrative structure.
4. Run from project tree root button frequently for full end-to-end checks.
5. Keep source control clean with the Version Control panel (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+G`).
6. Use the public documentation website or repository [Documentation Index](../../INDEX.md) for reference.
