# VNS Rollback & History

Complete reference for the VN rollback (rewind/fast-forward) system and the dialogue history backlog.

Rollback stack: `core/src/main/java/com/jvn/core/vn/rollback/VnRollbackStack.java`
Rollback entry: `core/src/main/java/com/jvn/core/vn/rollback/VnRollbackEntry.java`
History: `core/src/main/java/com/jvn/core/vn/VnHistory.java`

## Overview

JVN provides two complementary systems for reviewing past story content:

- **Rollback** — rewinds or fast-forwards the entire VN state to a previous/future dialogue point. Restores all visuals, characters, variables, and modes exactly as they were.
- **History** — a read-only log of speaker/text pairs for scrolling through past dialogue without changing game state.

---

## Rollback System

### How It Works

Every time a **dialogue node** is processed, the engine captures a snapshot of the full VN state and pushes it onto the rollback stack. This snapshot includes:

| Captured State | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `nodeIndex` | Position in the node list |
| `backgroundId` | Current background |
| `variables` | Full variable map (deep copy) |
| `visibleCharacters` | Character positions, expressions, and layer orders |
| `readNodes` | Which nodes have been visited |
| `callStack` | Subroutine return addresses |
| `globalPositionCharacters` | Characters with global positioning |
| `characterDefinedPositions` | Character → last assigned position |
| `skipMode` | Skip mode state |
| `autoPlayMode` | Auto-play mode state |
| `autoPlayTimer` | Auto-play countdown |
| `uiHidden` | UI visibility toggle |
| `dialogueSpeaker` | Speaker name at this point |
| `dialogueText` | Dialogue text at this point |
| `timestamp` | Capture time (epoch millis) |

### Stack Architecture

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ VnRollbackStack                              │
│                                              │
│  history (Deque)    future (Deque)           │
│  ┌──────────┐       ┌──────────┐            │
│  │ Entry N  │ ←top  │ Entry F1 │ ←top       │
│  │ Entry N-1│       │ Entry F2 │            │
│  │ ...      │       │ ...      │            │
│  │ Entry 1  │       └──────────┘            │
│  └──────────┘                                │
│                                              │
│  maxEntries = 100 (configurable)             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **History stack** — past rollback entries (newest on top)
- **Future stack** — entries that were rolled past (for forward navigation)
- **Max entries** — oldest entries are pruned when the limit is exceeded (default: 100)

### Capturing State

State is captured automatically after each dialogue node:

```java
// Called internally by VnScene.processDialogueNode()
state.captureRollbackState(speaker, text);
```

This calls:

```java
rollbackStack.capture(state, speaker, text);
```

Which creates an immutable `VnRollbackEntry` snapshot.

### Rolling Back

```java
if (state.canRollback()) {
    // Capture current state for the future stack
    VnRollbackEntry current = VnRollbackEntry.capture(state, currentSpeaker, currentText);
    VnRollbackEntry previous = rollbackStack.rollback(current);
    previous.applyTo(state);
}
```

When rolling back:
1. The current state is pushed onto the **future stack** (enabling forward)
2. The top of the **history stack** is popped
3. The popped entry is applied to `VnState`, restoring everything

### Rolling Forward

```java
if (state.canRollforward()) {
    VnRollbackEntry current = VnRollbackEntry.capture(state, currentSpeaker, currentText);
    VnRollbackEntry next = rollbackStack.rollforward(current);
    next.applyTo(state);
}
```

The inverse: current → history, future → applied.

### State Restoration Details

When `applyTo(state)` is called, it restores:

1. Node index and background
2. Variables (full map replacement)
3. Read nodes set
4. Call stack
5. All visible characters (cleared first, then re-shown with correct layer order)
6. Global position state
7. Skip mode, auto-play mode, and timers
8. UI hidden state
9. Resets: `waitingForInput=false`, `textRevealProgress=0`, history overlay closed, save slot overlay closed

### New Path Behavior

When a new dialogue is reached (new `push()`), the **future stack is cleared**. This matches the undo/redo pattern — once you take a new action after undoing, you can't redo the old path.

### Configuration

```java
// Default: 100 entries
VnRollbackStack stack = new VnRollbackStack();

// Custom depth
VnRollbackStack stack = new VnRollbackStack(200);
```

## Default Key Bindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Mouse Scroll Up** / **Page Up** | Roll back |
| **Mouse Scroll Down** / **Page Down** | Roll forward |

## History Backlog

### How It Works

Every dialogue node adds a `(speaker, text)` pair to the history log. This is independent of the rollback system — it is a simple, append-only chronological record.

### VnHistory API

```java
VnHistory history = state.getHistory();

// Entries are added automatically by VnScene
history.addEntry("Hero", "Let's go!");

// Read entries (newest last)
List<VnHistory.HistoryEntry> entries = history.getEntries();
for (VnHistory.HistoryEntry e : entries) {
    String speaker = e.getSpeaker();   // may be null for narration
    String text = e.getText();
    long timestamp = e.getTimestamp();  // epoch millis
}

// Stats
int count = history.size();

// Clear (e.g., on new game)
history.clear();
```

### Max Entries

Default: **200** entries. Oldest entries are pruned when the limit is exceeded.

```java
VnHistory history = new VnHistory(500); // Custom max
```

### History Overlay

The renderer provides a scrollable history overlay:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **L** / **Backspace** | Toggle history overlay |
| **Mouse Wheel** | Scroll history up/down |

The overlay shows:
- Timestamped speaker/text pairs
- Alternating row backgrounds for readability
- Header and footer with scroll hints
- Total entry count

### VNS Commands for History

```vns
# Toggle history overlay
[history toggle]

# Show history
[history show]

# Hide history
[history hide]
```

## Rollback vs History

| Feature | Rollback | History |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Rewind/restore game state | Review past dialogue |
| **Changes state** | Yes — full state restoration | No — read-only log |
| **Characters** | Restored to exact positions/expressions | Not tracked |
| **Variables** | Restored | Not tracked |
| **Background** | Restored | Not tracked |
| **Direction** | Forward and backward | Scroll only |
| **Max entries** | 100 (configurable) | 200 (configurable) |
| **Cleared on** | New game | New game |

## Interaction with Save/Load

- **Save** captures the current state but does **not** save the rollback stack or history. After loading a save, both start empty.
- **Autosave** works the same — rollback/history are session-only.
- Rolling back to a point before a save does not affect the save file.

---

## Common Patterns

### Preventing Rollback Past Critical Points

If you want to prevent the player from rolling back past a major story branch:

```vns
@label point_of_no_return
narrator: There's no going back now.
# The rollback stack still exists, but the player can only
# roll back to the most recent 100 dialogue lines.
# For hard prevention, clear rollback from Java code.
```

### Dialogue-Only Rollback

Rollback snapshots are only created at **dialogue nodes**. Non-interactive nodes (backgrounds, audio, jumps) are not individually captured. This means rolling back skips over groups of non-interactive commands and lands on the previous dialogue line — which is the expected UX for visual novels.
